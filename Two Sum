Problem Statement:

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Solution:

Looping for ith and ith+1 i.e jth element in the array, if the addition of ith and jth element is equal to the target then return ith and jth element. 

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(1,len(nums)):
                if nums[i]+nums[j]==target:
                    if i<j:
                        return(i,j)
