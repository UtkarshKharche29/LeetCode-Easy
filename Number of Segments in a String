Problem Statement:

Count the number of segments in a string, where a segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters.
Please note that the string does not contain any non-printable characters.

Example:

Input: "Hello, my name is John"
Output: 5


Solution:
class Solution:
    def countSegments(self, s: str) -> int:
        cnt=0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i]!=" " and (s[i-1]==" " or i==0):
                cnt+=1
        return cnt
