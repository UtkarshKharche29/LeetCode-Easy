Problem Statement:

Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.
Example 1:
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Note:
The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000



Solution:

class Solution(object):
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums):
        li=[0]
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i]==1:
                li[-1]+=nums[i]
            else:
                li.append(0)
        return max(li)
