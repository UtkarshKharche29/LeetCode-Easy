Problem Statement:
Students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights for an annual photo.
Return the minimum number of students that must move in order for all students to be standing in non-decreasing order of height.
Example 1:
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
 

Solution:
class Solution:
    def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        
        cnt=0
        sort=sorted(heights)
        for i in range(len(sort)):
            if sort[i]!=heights[i]:
                cnt+=1
        return(cnt)
