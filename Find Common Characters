Problem Statement:
Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including duplicates).  
For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.
You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]

Example 2:
Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]

Solution:
class Solution:
    def commonChars(self, A: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        count=collections.Counter(A[0])
        for i in range(1,len(A)):
            count=count&collections.Counter(A[i])
        li=[]
        for i in count.keys():
            if count[i]>1:
                li=li+([i]*count[i])                
            else:
                li.append(i)
        return(li)
