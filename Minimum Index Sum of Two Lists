Problem Statement:


Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.
You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all
of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

Example 1:
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".

Example 2:
Input:
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).



Solution:
class Solution:
    def findRestaurant(self, list1: List[str], list2: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        dict={}
        ans={}
        
        for i,j in enumerate(list1):
            dict[j]=i
        
        #print(dict)
        index=float("inf")
        for i,j in enumerate(list2):
            if j in dict:
                if dict[j]+i<=index:
                    index=dict[j]+i
                    ans[j]=index
        mn=min(ans.values())
        #print(ans)
        return [i for i,j in ans.items() if j==mn]
