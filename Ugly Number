Problem Statement:

Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.

Example 1:
Input: 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 × 3

Example 2:
Input: 8
Output: true
Explanation: 8 = 2 × 2 × 2

Example 3:
Input: 14
Output: false 
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.



Solution:

class Solution(object):
    def isUgly(self, num):
        if num<=0:
            return False
        
        li=[2,3,5]
        for i in li:
            while num%i==0:
                num=num/i
                print(num)
            if num==1:
                return True
        return False
