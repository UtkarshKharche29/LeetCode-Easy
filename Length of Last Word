Problem Statement:

Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.
If the last word does not exist, return 0.
Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

Solution:

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        lis=s.split()
        if len(lis)<1:
            return(0)
        else:
            return(len(lis[-1]))
